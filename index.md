# <u>From Signals and Systems to Machine Learning</u>

Hello! My name is **Ryan Tsai**, and I'm a **machine learning and AI engineering student** enrolled in the Machine Learning Engineering bootcamp at WeCloudData. I'm a **career switcher - I have 10 years of experience as a systems engineer** for commercial cellular (4G and 5G) modem chipsets at Qualcomm and at Zeku.

[About Me (placeholder)](https://rfdspeng.github.io/pages/about_me)

**My previous work experience has given me the skills and knowledge needed to successfully transition to data science and machine learning.**

**There are many shared or analogous concepts between signals and systems and machine learning:**
* Like data, signals are represented as high-dimensional vectors, and like data passing through machine learning models, signals undergo successive linear and nonlinear transformations as they pass through signal processing chains.
* Linear regression is a simple model in machine learning, and it's also used to design linear and nonlinear signal processing blocks. However, the weights in signal processing blocks are typically found by solving the normal equation instead of by gradient descent.
* Just like machine learning models, signal processing blocks balance bias and variance.
* **Most importantly, both fields require an engineer's mindset. The process of optimizing models and filters is the same - iterative testing, analysis, and adjustment based on quantitative metrics.**

**Here are some of my skills**, and please take a look at my [resume]({{ site.resume }}) and my projects to see how I've applied them:
* Programming languages: Python, MATLAB
* Machine learning frameworks: Hugging Face, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TorchMetrics, CUDA
* Data analysis and visualization: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib
* Tools: Git, Conda, Spyder, Jupyter

# <u>Projects</u>
